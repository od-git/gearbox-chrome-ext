# gearbox-chrome-ext
Chrome extension to improve the display of health metrics on [Gearbox.fi App](app.gearbox.fi).

Shows maximum drawdown percentage of the account value to reach the liquidation zone (health factor of 1).

This is just a tiny quick&dirty extension, which does not display well in every situation, but it mostly serves its purpose.
